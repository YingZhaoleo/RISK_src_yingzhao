source code related to the following papers:
- Resource-aware asynchronous multi-agent coordination via self-triggered MPC
- Resource-aware stochastic self-triggered model predictive control
- Joint energy management for distributed energy harvesting systems
- Robust resource-aware self-triggered model predictive control
- Scheduling Delays and Curtailment for Household Appliances With Deterministic Load Profiles Using MPC

Agent.m: class of self-triggered control agent, test_one_agent for its validation
load_scheduling: source code used to generate the result in "Scheduling Delays and Curtailment for Household Appliances With Deterministic Load Profiles Using MPC"
uncertain_self_trigger: source code that can be used to generate results in robust/stochastic self-triggered MPC (NOTE that the ODE is different, only the implementation is similar)
